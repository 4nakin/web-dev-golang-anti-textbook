#Routing

Till now we used routing directly inside of our handlers. For a large application though, it'd be better to have a router
in place. We can either use a third party one with countless features or the standard mux.

As our application matures, routing plays a big role into it. We intentionally avoided routing till now because as a web developer, we must understand
what happens in the background of our application. Web frameworks allow us to build applications quickly, but the downside of them is that they provide
us with a _framework_ as the name suggests, which means you are totally restricted by the API which the framework will provide. Thus we need to know how
to implement bare bone stuff, so in future we might want to modify the framework we need, or rather create our own one.
