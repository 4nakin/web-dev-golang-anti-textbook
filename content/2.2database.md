#Setting up Database

The go language makes it easy to switch underlying database pretty easily given that they have an interface which database libraries
should implement, which makes it just a matter of giving a different connection in our file for the database switch to work. But the language
doesn't give built in libraries to interface with different database vendors, they have defined an interface at `database/sql`. If you use
database drivers which follow this interface then one can switch the underlying database with minimal change.  

We'll use the sqlite database, if you have Python installed in your *nix machine then generally sqlite comes preinstalled. If not then you need to
install it.

###Creating and configuring database

You can use the package manager of your OS to install sqlite3 database.

After installation use this DDL to create a table in our database

		[Tasks] $ sqlite3 tasks.db
		SQLite version 3.8.2 2013-12-06 14:53:30
		Enter ".help" for instructions
		Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
		sqlite> CREATE TABLE task (
			id integer primary key autoincrement,
			title varchar(100),
			content text,
			is_deleted char(1) default 'N',
			created_date timestamp,
			last_modified_at timestamp,
			finish_date timestamp
			);
		
Use the following insert statements to enter data in our table, so we'll begin reading data in our showalltasks function which we wrote in the previous chapter

		INSERT INTO "task" VALUES(1,'Publish on github',
			'Publish the source of tasks and picsort on github',
			'N','2015-11-12 15:30:59','2015-11-21 14:19:22',
			'2015-11-17 17:02:18');
		
		INSERT INTO "task" VALUES(4,'gofmtall',
			'The idea is to run gofmt -w file.go on every 
		go file in the listing, *Edit turns out this is is difficult 
		to do in golang **Edit barely 3 line bash script :P '
		,'N','2015-11-12 16:58:31',
		'2015-11-14 10:42:14','2015-11-13 13:16:48');
		
		INSERT INTO "task" VALUES(7,'modifications to task',
			'1. add search function #Done
				2. a priority feature to task
				3. comments on tasks
				4. Due date
				5. remove dependency on httprouter #Done',
			'N','2015-11-13 04:23:27','2015-11-13 04:23:27',NULL);


##Installing the sqlite driver for go

We'll use the go-sqlite3 driver created by github.com/mattn. Type this in your terminal:

		go get "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3" 

##Accessing database in go

We import the library as `import _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"` 

`_` is called the empty operator and when we want to use it natively we give it to the import statements.
Explanation about *natively*, when we import any package, then by default it gets imported as per its name, for instance when
we import `net/http` we'll use it as `http.` for accessing functions and variables of the package, but since `go-sqlite3` is a database
package which uses the `database/sql` interfaces, this is the reason in Go you can switch databases by just giving a different connection
the underlying code more or less remains the same.

###Note:
The _ operator has a unique role in go, it is used to denote an empty variable, suppose we want to not use a value returned by 
a function then we'd use it like this

		a, _ := getValue()

here the function returns two values, the first one we store in a and another one we ignore by using the `_` operator, this is
because Go doesn't allow us to keep unused variables in our code.

Also that we can give an alias instead of the underscore character should we want one for our package.


We then have to define a object to hold the database connection when we open it, we do it as follows

		var database   *sql.DB

We have to do this immediately out of the import statements because we want it to be a global variable for this package, but we
don't name it as Database since we don't want it to be accessible outside of our database package, we'll write methods to encapsulate
database functionality so we keep our database access logic all in one package rather than sprinkling it around recklessly.

		database, err = sql.Open("sqlite3", "./tasks.db")
		
		if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
		}

This statement calls the system `database/sql` package, the first argument is the database type and the second one is the URL or file,
when we use sqlite then we pass it a file name, otherwise we pass it the URL along with the port where the database server is running, 
also note that over here, we can selectively let Go establish a database connection for mysql/postgres/sqlite and then use the other 
functions as they are interchangable due to the unique architecture of Go itself, which is nice considering we can prototype an application
quickly in sqlite and then go ahead with big databases like postgres.

Please refer to the documentation of `database/sql` for more details.

##Querying the database

We use the `Query` method to query the database with some sql query which we'll construct

		getTasksql = "select id, title, content, created_date from task
			where finish_date is null and is_deleted='N' order by created_date asc"
			
		rows, err := database.Query(getTasksql)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
		}
		defer rows.Close()
		for rows.Next() {
			err := rows.Scan(&TaskID, &TaskTitle, &TaskContent, &TaskCreated)
			TaskContent = strings.Replace(TaskContent, "\n", "<br>", -1)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
			}
			fmt.Println(TaskID, TaskTitle, TaskContent, TaskCreated)
		}

	
######Note: Defer
The defer keyword is a yet another blessing for Go programmers, gone are the days of adding that `finally` block while doing exception handling
the go language takes care of that block through the defer keyword, consider it as a statement which'll run after all the statements of the `function`
are done executing. Please take note of this statement carefully, `defer` statement executes when the last statement of `that function` executed, so 
care should be exercised while using the defer statement.


open `~/main/main.go` and write this in it

There is something wrong with this code, fix it form the information you got from this chapter.

		package main
		import (
			_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3" //we want to use sqlite natively
			"fmt"
		)
		
		var database   *sql.DB
		
		func init() {
			defer database.Close()
			database, err = sql.Open("sqlite3", "./tasks.db")
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
			}
		}
		//intentional bug exists
		func main() {
			getTasksql = "select id, title, content, created_date from task
				where finish_date is null and is_deleted='N' order by created_date asc"
				
			rows, err := database.Query(getTasksql)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
			}
			defer rows.Close()
			for rows.Next() {
				err := rows.Scan(&TaskID, &TaskTitle, &TaskContent, &TaskCreated)
				TaskContent = strings.Replace(TaskContent, "\n", "<br>", -1)
				if err != nil {
					fmt.Println(err)
				}
				fmt.Println(TaskID, TaskTitle, TaskContent, TaskCreated)
			}
		}


######Note: the init() function

The init() function is the function which executes first before the file is imported or
executed, suppose we run the main file, then the init statement will execute first and then the rest of the code will execute
similarly when we import this file, it is the init function which runs first and later the rest of the code. So initialization which is to be done for
the whole package/file level should be done in this function itself.


##Writing data into the database

Provided you found the bug in the above program, we have seen how to fetch data from the database, now it is time to write data into the database, this is
done in two ways, by starting a transaction or without one. One should always start a transaction before inserting data into the database because otherwise
it leads to database is lock error and secondly it is simply an incorrect way to use a database for there is a good reason transactions were invented.
Don't take my word for it, I'd encourage you to find out the other method to write data into the database and see it for yourself.

Below lies an example of using transaction

file `db/db.go`

		//RestoreTask is used to restore tasks from the Trash
		func RestoreTask(id int) error {
			query:="update task set is_deleted='N',last_modified_at=datetime() where id=?"
			restoreSQL, err := database.Prepare(query)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
			}
			tx, err := database.Begin()
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
			}
			_, err = tx.Stmt(restoreSQL).Exec(id)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("doing rollback")
				tx.Rollback()
			} else {
				tx.Commit()
			}
			return err
		}


#####Note: Error handling
Go takes a different approach to exception handling than popular languages which use the try catch statements, although this results in one list in the
`if err != nil` land, but this makes the language small and simpler to handle exceptions because we don't need to remember those 1010101 different classes
the language/library takes care to identify the exception type for us and returns a error string, which we check for nil and then take some action on it.
