#Functionality of webapp

We are going to create a todo list manager, so we have to decide upon what our webapp will do. The design phase is the most important in any
software project since it is the making or breaking point for the ones who implement, and one small mistake in designing costs the project
serverly and what we call as a solution for a design problem isn't really a solution but it is a hack, a glue which sticks things together.

Our webapp is going to be a todo list manager for a single user, so it'll have the following features:

		1. Ability to add/delete/modify task.
		2. Ability to mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
		3. Display the tasks as a one column list.
		4. Ability to switch modes between pending tasks/completed tasks/ deleted tasks
		5. Display notifications like note added/deleted/archived 
		6. Search for text and highlight the text in the search results phase.

##One way to build a webapp

There are many ways we can build software, but not every way is better, herein we explain one way that we think is better while building software

We then decide on our API, for instance how exactly is our app going to behave?

		/add/ POST = add new task
		/ 	GET	   = show pending tasks
		/complete/ GET = show completed tasks
		/deleted/ GET = show deleted tasks
		/edit/<id> POST = edit post
		/edit/<id> GET = show the edit page
		/trash/<id> POST = trash post to recycle bin
		/delete/<id> POST = permanently delete post
		/complete/<id> POST = mark post as complete
		/login/ POST = do the login
		/login/ GET = show login page and if user is not 
					  authenticated then show /login/ for any URL
		/logout/ POST = log the user out
		/restore/<id> POST = restore that task
		/update/<id> POST = update task, edit page will call this URL
		/change/ GET = will allow changing password
		/register/ GET = show the register page
		/register/ POST = will add entries into database

#####Note:
For purpose of simplicity we are not going to have login logout feature as of now, but we'll build it once the application is done, the purpose is
that we need to learn how to build a webapp incrementally, but we do want to make clear that security isn't something you append to a webapp or 
anything for that matter, it should be integral to the application, but then again this is a tutorial to learn how to make apps, once you learn all
the concepts here you should make sure you implement the login logout function first and then start writing the other features. 

The use of this activity is that one can then go ahead and create a mobile application for our todo list manager, because the mobile app will use
JSON format as input, we can implement that feature in our application so we can easily scale up to mobile applications.

open your `~/main/main.go`

		package main
		import (
			"log"
			"net/http"
		)
		
		func main() {
			http.HandleFunc("/", ShowAllTasksFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/complete/", CompleteTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/delete/", DeleteTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/deleted/", ShowTrashTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/trash/", TrashTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/edit/", EditTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/completed/", ShowCompleteTasksFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/restore/", RestoreTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/add/", AddTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/update/", UpdateTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/search/", SearchTaskFunc)
			http.HandleFunc("/login", GetLogin)
			http.HandleFunc("/register", PostRegister)
			http.HandleFunc("/admin", HandleAdmin)
			http.HandleFunc("/add_user", PostAddUser)
			http.HandleFunc("/change", PostChange)
			http.HandleFunc("/", HandlePage)
			http.HandleFunc("/logout", HandleLogout)
		
			http.Handle("/static/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("public")))
			log.Print("running on port 8080")
			log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
		}

in this file itself, create all functions we mentioned above and make the necessary changes as per one definition that we show below

		func ShowAllTasksFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			if r.Method == "GET" {
				message := "all pending tasks GET"
			} else {
				message := "all pending tasks POST"
			}
			w.Write([]byte(message))
		}

After you create these functions run the server as below,
 
		[Tasks] $ go build main/main.go
		[Tasks] $ ./main/main
	
Now go to firefox and type `localhost:8080` since our server is listening on port 8080, then go ahead and type all these URLs and see what message you get
on the html page being served.

##Homework

Check the documentation for the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request objects and get to know all the variables/functions/constants for http package and these
two which we mentioned
