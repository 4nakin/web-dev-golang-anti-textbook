#Designing our web app

We are going to build a todo list manager, so we have to decide upon what our webapp will do. The design phase is the most important in any
software project since it is the making or breaking point for the ones who implement, and one small mistake in designing costs the project
serverly and what we call as a solution for a design problem isn't really a solution but it is a hack, a glue which sticks things together.

Our webapp is going to be a todo list manager for a single user, so it'll have the following features:

		1. Ability to add/delete/modify task.
		2. Ability to mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
		3. Display the tasks as a one column list.
		4. Ability to switch modes between pending/completed/deleted tasks
		5. Display notifications like note added/deleted/archived 
		6. Search for text and highlight the text in the search results page.

### The Design

There is an urge for getting to program as soon as possible, but in Software Engineering, actual programming constitutes around 5% of all the effort,
for programming is just translating ideas into computer executable code. Hence the time given to design is very important for any application. 

We decide on our API, for instance how exactly is our app going to behave?

			/add/ POST = add new task
			/ 	GET	   = show pending tasks
			/complete/ GET = show completed tasks
			/deleted/ GET = show deleted tasks
			/edit/<id> POST = edit post
			/edit/<id> GET = show the edit page
			/trash/<id> POST = trash post to recycle bin
			/delete/<id> POST = permanently delete post
			/complete/<id> POST = mark post as complete
			/login/ POST = do the login
			/login/ GET = show login page and if user is not 
						authenticated then show /login/ for any URL
			/logout/ POST = log the user out
			/restore/<id> POST = restore that task
			/update/<id> POST = update task, edit page will call this URL
			/change/ GET = will allow changing password
			/register/ GET = show the register page
			/register/ POST = will add entries into database

file `~/main/main.go`

			package main
			import (
				"log"
				"net/http"
			)
			
			func main() {
				http.HandleFunc("/", ShowAllTasksFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/complete/", CompleteTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/delete/", DeleteTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/deleted/", ShowTrashTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/trash/", TrashTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/edit/", EditTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/completed/", ShowCompleteTasksFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/restore/", RestoreTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/add/", AddTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/update/", UpdateTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/search/", SearchTaskFunc)
				http.HandleFunc("/login", GetLogin)
				http.HandleFunc("/register", PostRegister)
				http.HandleFunc("/admin", HandleAdmin)
				http.HandleFunc("/add_user", PostAddUser)
				http.HandleFunc("/change", PostChange)
				http.HandleFunc("/logout", HandleLogout)
			
				http.Handle("/static/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("public")))
				log.Print("running on port 8080")
				log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
			}

In this file itself, create all functions we mentioned above and make the necessary changes as per one definition that we show below

			func ShowAllTasksFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
				if r.Method == "GET" {
					message := "all pending tasks GET"
				} else {
					message := "all pending tasks POST"
				}
				w.Write([]byte(message))
			}

After you create these functions run the server as below,
 
			[Tasks] $ go build main/main.go
			[Tasks] $ ./main/main
	
In your browser type `localhost:8080` and type all these URLs and see what message you get.

### Homework

Check the documentation for `http.ResponseWriter` and `http.Request` objects and get to know all the variables/functions/constants for http package and these
two which we mentioned
