#Closing remarks

In the above chapter we saw how to read and write data into the database through our web application, this is the gist of any web application. 
As of now our code is a monolithic single file code, we would like to split it into packages, one for database, one for type, one for views.

##Homework

The homework is to split the code into packages and get it to work, the type definition goes into the `types/types.go` file, the handler definition 
goes into the `views/views.go`, the database read and write methods go into the `db/db.go`. Make sure that after you refractor the code, that
the code runs.
