#Sneak Peak into the future

To its core, web servers are nothing but a program running in the memory of the computer where it is deployed. Let's take an example 
of google.com, somewhere in the massive data farms that the company works, is a program written to serve something when it gets a 
page request.

When we hit the url http://www.google.com then our GET request is routed thoroughout the world to the server or proxy server running the 
source code for the google search engine, web servers are written to accept the HTTP protocol, the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, whilst originally
written to transfer text, now it can transfer multimedia objects like images, videos. The way the protocol is built enables the Internet to be
platform independant, which means who created the device doesn't matter so long as they have a software that can send and receive data in HTTP
these softwares are called the web browsers. The browser encapsulates the sending and receiving of web requests.

Until AJAX was invented, the servers served static html pages, they took the input from the URL, if the URL is google.com/, (if you are wondering 
from where the / came from, then the browser firefox/chrome or whichever you use adds it for you when it sends a HTTP request), the browser will 
send a HTTP GET request for the URL /, it is the responsibilty of the server to send a HTTP Response back to that respective IP address. As far as
we web developers are concerned, we have to write software which will is programmed to respond to particular requests.

##Example

Suppose we run a blog, the smallest component of which is a post, a post has tags, it is written by some author, at some time and has some primary key
to uniquely identify it in our database and it has a slug which means the URL.

Earlier URLs used to be ugly, but now they are beautiful, like our fictional blog has this post, `surajblog.com/posts/welcome-the-new-year`,
the slug is the `welcome-the-new-year`.

When the server gets a HTTP GET request of `/posts/welcome-the-new-year`, it'll search for URL handlers starting with the list of URL 
handlers we have given, then it'll find the closest match, in our case it'll be `/post/`, then it'll call the handler of this URL.

What this handler will do is that it'll go to the database, fetch the (id, title, content, time) from the database for that particular post
then it'll read a `template` and populate data into the template, which is ultimately the HTML document which is sent back to our browser.

##What is a template?

While building web applications in any programming language, we have a templating language associated with it, as the name suggests, is a template
a model, giving you the taste of a real life template being used in the webapp which we'll create eventually, is part of the template pasted below.

It first checks the `Tasks` is empty, and if it is empty then it'll show No Tasks here, otherwise it'll loop through the object and how all the Tasks
which are in the object.

    <div class="timeline">
    {{ if .Tasks}} {{range .Tasks}}
        <div class="note">
    <p class="noteHeading">{{.Title}}</p>
    <hr>
      <p class="noteContent">{{.Content}}</p>
    </div>
    {{end}} {{else}}
    <div class="note">
      <p class="noteHeading">No Tasks here</p>
    </div>
	{{end}}

>Note: It is a good UX practice to provide a way to add Tasks while showing the *No Tasks here* message

So writing a web application essentially means, we have to decide upon the URLs, the structure of the database and write functions in golang to handle 
each supported pattern of URL, then write templates to populate each URL, the handlers which we write populate data in the templates, a method generally
known as **rendering**.

###Not abusing templates

Templates support a lot of things like in template variables, but one has to make sure that there is no business logic inside the template and we
separate the business logic from the presentation. Web apps which follow these are easily maintainable since the change in business logic doesn't mean
that we have to change everything, but with one app divided into modules, this triggers a changed in that particular part of the module.

Suppose we write a todo list manager which supports multiple users, so we have to ensure that we show tasks of that particular user rather than 
sending all the tasks to the template and filtering there tasks which are of that user. A better approach will surely be to pass the tasks of only that
user while rendering the template, so in the future if we want to show tasks of some user and his friend, then we won't have to change the template, we'll
just modify the function which populates the Tasks object.

Below is such method which is used to handle the backend functionality of our *EditTask* URL which is `/edit/<id>`
located at `~/db/db.go`

    func GetTaskByID(id int) types.Context {
      var tasks []types.Task
      var task types.Task
      var TaskID int
	    var TaskTitle string
	    var TaskContent string
	    getTasksql := "select id, title, content from task where id=?"

	   rows, err := database.Query(getTasksql, id)
	   if err != nil {
 		    fmt.Println(err)
 	   }
	   defer rows.Close()
	   if rows.Next() {
		   err := rows.Scan(&TaskID, &TaskTitle, &TaskContent)
		   if err != nil {
			   fmt.Println(err)
		   }
		   task = types.Task{Id: TaskID, Title: TaskTitle, Content: TaskContent}
	   }
	   tasks = append(tasks, task)
	   context := types.Context{Tasks: tasks, Navigation: "edit"}
	   return context
    }


If you notice, we aren't rendering the template here, because this is a database package who's job is to return the appropriate data to the view,
which will render the template from the data sent by the database function.
file path: `~/views/views.go`

    //EditTaskFunc is used to edit tasks, handles "/edit/" URL
    func EditTaskFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      if r.Method == "GET" {
        id, err := strconv.Atoi(r.URL.Path[len("/edit/"):])
        if err != nil {
          fmt.Println(err)
        } else {
          task := db.GetTaskByID(id)
          editTemplate.Execute(w, task)
        }
      } else {
        message = "Method not allowed"
        http.Redirect(w, r, "/", http.StatusFound)
      }
    }

Thus we can split an application into views, database, templates and the main file. This is the standard way of doing things in this world, not because it is
the status quo, but because it is easier to maintain the webapplications that way and since maintainability is the holy grail for software
you are recommended to follow this.

The main file will get the URL pattern and match with the handlers which are present in views, the views get the items from the database and render
the necessary template.
