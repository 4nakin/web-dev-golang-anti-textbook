#Workspace

The official way of programming in golang is to make a folder which'll be the golang universe on your machine and reference it as a environment 
variable called `$GOPATH`. 

Suppose for me `$GOPATH` is ``/usr/home/suraj/go``, it has the following structure
- pkg: The libraries which'll be imported in our code, there is a `.a` file created at the respective path.
- bin: The binary file of our project will be installed here on calling `go install` in the project folder
- src: Will hold the actual code, if you have a github account, then you can create a folder tree inside like

go
- src
	- github.com
		- thewhitetulip
			- wshare
			- picsort
	- golang.net
	- sourcegraph.com
- bin (binaries)
	- wshare 
	- picsort
- pkg

It is very easy to make packages in golang, and the above enforced structure makes programming quite atomic, instead of having
one huge file for everything, you can tuck everything into it's own package and distribute the logic of your program into
multiple packages.

This also makes it simple for other people to use your packages, for my Tasks application `github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/database` is the package
which encapsulates the database related stuff like adding task, deleting task. When we install packages we do a `go get github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/database`
this will take the files and folders on the github repository and put it in our `~/go/src/github.com/Tasks/database`. 

When we use this package we will write `import github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/database`.

One might argue that we will not use the github naming convention and make the folders directly inside the `src` directory, in that way we can import packages
which have a single letter names like database, rather than the long names, while this is possible, it is not recommended for multiple reasons, first, it might break
the flow of people who fork your project, for instance when you clone `github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/` it'll import all the required packages too, and 
if the packages were created just in the src directory, then it'll break the application, since if my db package isn't `github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks/db` but just `db`
then the `go get` command will be unable to get the `db` package because it won't know how to get it.

#Build

In each repo there will be one file in the `main` package, while there is no hard and fast rule to make a main package, but when done, the way to 
call the application is detailed below:

- With main package:

			[Tasks] $ go build main/main.go
			[Tasks] $ ./main/main

But if you go to main folder and build and run then it won't run

			[Tasks/main] $ go build main.go
			[Tasks/main] $ ./main

This won't run because as per our instruction, the binary will expect all the static files and the rest of the packages in the current directory,
which is the directory called *main*, but all our other files are present one level up, so we have to ensure that we call the binary from one level up.

The `go build` command makes an executable of the current golang project, we can use the `go run main.go`. The `go run` command actually runs the `go build` command
but the executable is made inside the temporary directory `/tmp` in Linux

When we run `go install`, the binary of the existing project is moved to `$GOPATH/bin` directory, when we add this in the `$PATH` then we can use whichever utility we
made to call from anywhere on the commandline.
