# Go Programming Basics

### Workspace

## `$GOPATH` and `$GOROOT`

$GOROOT: This is an environment variable which stores the path where your Go installation is present if you have customized it.
$GOPATH: The Go universe for your machine. The idea is that all your Go code should reside in a directory tree so the code isn't lying around in random places.  

In most unix systems it is done with `export GOPATH=/usr/home/suraj/Go`. 

My `$GOPATH` is ``/usr/home/suraj/Go``, it has the following structure
- pkg: The libraries which'll be imported in our code, there is a `.a` file created at the respective path.
- bin: The binary file of our project will be installed here on calling `Go install` in the project folder
- src: Will hold the actual code, if you have a github account, then you can create a folder tree inside like

Go
- src
	- github.com
		- thewhitetulip
			- wshare
			- picsort
	- golang.net
	- sourcegraph.com
- bin (binaries)
	- wshare 
	- picsort
- pkg

Go takes this unique approach so that all the Go code is well organized and not thrown in a haphazard manner. This makes it easy to locate code for humans and software alike.

### Packages

Packages, in Go, are just one or more file(s) which contains Go source code. It can be named anything, but it needs to be a in a folder and each file in the package should have the line `package <name>` at the top. The folder name has to be exactly same as the `<name>` we specifiy in each package source file.

There can be any number of files in a package directory, but only *one file with the main package*. While building the code, the compiler starts with the main package. 

### MVC Patterns
When I started learning building web apps in Django, I first read about the MVC pattern, the models, the views and what not. But that knowledge was to be *assumed* by me and I had no idea why that decision was made, along with that Django works like magic, one has to adapt to it's quirks. Hence while programming in Go, it'll be immensely benefitial to grow up to the MVC pattern by starting out small. The first app should entirely reside in the main.go file, then slowly, as the app grows, it needs to be structured well, so the all the handlers go into a views package, templates go in a templates folder, database related entities go in another package.  

Learning by doing and experimenting is the best way. Challenge the status quo.

##Package naming
The actual package name is just "views" or "views", the package is found out by the compiler from it's absolute path from the `$GOPATH/src` directory. For the Tasks app, it resides in `$GOPATH/src/github/thewhitetulip/Tasks`, thus, my packages will lie within the Tasks folder. This makes it easy for distributing the libraries. Theoretically, one can create a package directly in the `$GOPATH/src` folder to skip out the long naming conventions, but doing so breaks the code distribution via version control. 

When packages are resolved, by the Go compiler, it first looks in the standard library and then starts looking for the **full** name in the `$GOPATH/src` folder.  

### Internal deployment

We'll follow the standard practice and put our code in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks` folder. While testing our app, we need a deployment version. I useed `Tasks` whiel building Tasks, I have made a folder `~/Tasks` and here I keep the deployment version of Tasks, which contains the binary version and the static files. Every new build in the src gets pushed in this folder.

### Running a server
We deploy webapps on IP addresses on specific ports. Typically we choose a large port number like 8000 so it doesn't affect some other applications. Certain ports are restricted and need sudo access, like 80.

The IP address we bind the server to can be a public or private. Public means using ":8080" or "0.0.0.0:8080". Private means "127.0.0.1:8080"

Public means any computer in the same network can access the web app. Private means only your computer will be able to access it.
	
	//Public
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
	//Private
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:8080", nil))

###### Note: 127.0.0.1

`127.0.0.1`, called localhost, is a special IP address which is given to every machine to refer to itself. it doesn't matter if you are 
connected to the network or not, your machine will always have this IP address, so if you are want privacy use `127.0.0.1`.

If you do want your web application to be accessible then use `0.0.0.0.0:8080` or just `:8080`, when you give just the port number, the Go language assumes the IP address the machine is on but **not** `127.0.0.1`.
