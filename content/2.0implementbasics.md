#Basic application

Golang has a powerful built in http library situated in the net package. We import it in our application using the 
`import net/http` statement.

Make a folder in your `$GOPATH/src/github.com/<yourname>/Tasks` substitute your username in lieu of yourname.

		[Tasks] $ mkdir main
		[Tasks] $ touch main/main.go
	
file `main/main.go`

		package main
		
		import (
			"log"
			"net/http"
		)
		
		func main() {
			PORT := "8080"
			log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(PORT, nil))
		}

Now go to your terminal and type

		[Tasks] $ go run main/main.go

After you run the main.go file, you will notice that the program does nothing, it doesn't print anything because we told it
only to listen on the port, this is according to the logic of golang that `no message is good` and that errors have to be explicit. But there is no
need to adhere to that philosophy 100% because some times it is good to notify what is happening to the application, of course it doesn't mean that
we print each and every thing happening in the execution, that is for the `-v` verbose mode.

So make this change to the main file

		package main
		
		import (
			"log"
			"net/http"
		)
		
		func main() {
			PORT := ":8080"
			log.Print("Running server on "+ PORT)
			log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(PORT, nil))
		} 

Now run this like we mentioned above and we see this message on the terminal

		2016/01/01 22:00:36 Running server on :8080

Open your browser and open `localhost:8080`, you'll get the message "404 page not found"

This is because as of now we have just started a server to listen on the port 8080 but we haven't written anything to it yet. When we go to
`localhost:8080`, we are sending a HTTP GET request with the URL as `/`, and since it can't find any handler handling the `/` URL, it'll display
the standard HTTP404 error which means page not found.

##Handling URLs

		http.HandleFunc("/complete/", CompleteTaskFunc)
		
		//ShowCompleteTasksFunc is used to populate the "/completed/" URL
		func ShowCompleteTasksFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		}

We use the HandleFunc function in the `net/http` package to handle the URLs, in this function we pass the first argument
as the URL to be handled and the second parameter as either the full fledged function definition or a function object
while it is possible to define a function in the parameter itself, it isn't the best way to write a web application and shoul
be avoided.

##Simple view

We will wrap this chapter up with an example of writing the URL name on the page we are rendering, so if the user goes to `/golang/1234` then
will write `/golang/1234` on the webpage which she gets to see on `localhost:8080/golang/1234`.

		package main
		
		import (
			"log"
			"net/http"
		)
		
		func main() {
			PORT := ":8080"
			log.Print("Running server on "+ PORT)
			http.HandleFunc("/",CompleteTaskFunc)
			log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(PORT, nil))
		}
		
		func CompleteTaskFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			w.Write([]byte(r.URL.Path))
		}

##Parameterized routing
The above example works fine, as long as it is simple enough, we need to make modifications for handling parameterized routing.

		//DeleteTaskFunc is used to delete a task, 
		//trash = move to recycle bin, delete = permanent delete
		func DeleteTaskFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			if r.Method == "GET" {
				id := r.URL.Path[len("/delete/"):]
				w.Write([]byte("delete the "+id+ " task"))
		}

Since in a previous example we showed how to get hold of the URL in a view handler it is only intuitive that when we process the handler
we take the URL, then take a sub string of the URL and remove the `/delete/` part and we have the ID of the task which we'll now delete.

##Serving static files
		http.Handle("/static/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("public")))

For static file serving, we use the `FileServer` method present in the http package which serves the files which of the folder which is given
as a argument of the function.

##Homework

No book can just be read, you have to take some additional efforts on your side too

-  Read the documentation of `net/http` & `log` and get to know of the methods/functions in the packages [1]
-  Find out how many alternatives are there to ListenAndServe.


#####Note:
for documentation, just type `$ godoc -v -http=:6060` on your terminal then after a certain amount of time it'll start the godoc server
then go to localhost:6060, sadly we have to use the -v flag just to know when the server actually started, if you go to the /pkg/ URL of the
godoc server then you'll find that godoc runs on each go project in your $GOPATH, so if you have a lot of packages then it'll take a long time
so we have to use the -v mode, which is the verbose mode.


###Footnotes
[1]: one amazing aspect of golang is its small library, at any point of time it is possible to know all the functions of one package, this is not
possible with other languages who have blown up to the state where you can't program without a manual, but that doesn't mean that reading manuals
is bad, on contrary it is going to help if we read more documentation, which detail the API.
