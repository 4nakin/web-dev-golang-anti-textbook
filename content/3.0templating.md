#Templates

package: `text/template`

In the first chapter we had a cursory glance over the concept of templates.  This chapter is dedicated entirely to templates.
As we said previously, a web application responds to certain URLs and gives an html page to the browser which the browser then
interprets and shows to the end user. This html page which is sent to the browser is what is called templates in the backend
for we have a template which stores some variables, and in real time data is provided into the template which makes it a 
complete html page.

Let's take a practical example. Suppose we are building a micro blogging site. We would start with creating the front end in html.
Our microblogging site will show `Hi User` on the right corner.

In our static html we write this `<p>Hi User</p>`

But if we serve this page on our webserver it'll not change anything, it'll show `Hi User`, the name of the user won't come 
magically, we have to put it into the page somehow, here we use a variable so in Go we'd approach this by using a variable named `{{.Name}}`
so our html now will be `<p>Hi {{.Name}}</p>`. The `.` is mandatory.

Now, this is the logic we apply to all our html pages, keeping such `{{}}` variable expansion parameters and serving the value of the 
parameter while executing the template. If you are wondering how we'd do that, this is the syntax

		homeTemplate.Execute(w, context)
		
		//Context is the struct passed to templates
		type Context struct {
			Tasks      []Task
			Name	   string
			Search     string
			Message    string
		}

These are the three parts of using templates, first you need to create types like we have created the `Context` type, then we need to read the template, 
then we need to use the components of that type in our template file. So what remains now is passing an object of that type during template execution.

Reading template:

		templates, err = template.ParseFiles(allFiles...)
		
Where allFiles is populated as below:

		var allFiles []string
		templatesDir := "./public/templates/"
		files, err := ioutil.ReadDir(templatesDir)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Error reading template dir")
		}
		for _, file := range files {
			filename := file.Name()
			if strings.HasSuffix(filename, ".html") {
				allFiles = append(allFiles, templatesDir+filename)
			}
		}
		

#####Note: 
 1. `...` operator : allFiles is a string slice and allFiles... passes the function a parameter as a string.
 
 2. ParseFiles performance: 

    There is one point to note here about performance in parsing files, typically a template file won't change until there is some major change to the codebase
    so we should only parse the files **once**, rather than keep this code in each view handler and doing a 
    
    			template.ParseFiles("home.html")
    			template.Execute(w, context)
    	
    This block of code will unnecessarily read the html page each time while serving the response of a request, which means if ten people are using our blogging site
    then for each page they visit the code will read the html page, but there is no need to do things this way, we can read the html files once at the start and then
    use the `Lookup` method of the template class,
    
    			homeTemplate = templates.Lookup("home.html")
    			homeTemplate.Execute(w, context)


##Sub templating

So now we learnt how to pass data to templates and display it in the html page, it so happens that a lot of code is used in all templates
suppose the navigation bar or the header, then we need not write the same chunk everywhere, we can create a template to store that, and use sub templating ```{{template "_head.html" .}}```

Here, we have identified a chunk of code which we want to replicate and put it in `_head.html`. Then we put the above statement in each template 
file where we wish to have our header. This way templates become a lot smaller and don't contain replicated code everywhere. Do note that the `.` before the first `}` is intentional and it means that all the variables which were passed to the current template are passed to the sub template.

Note here that any sub template you use like this needs to be read in our go code. If we use the above logic to populate the `allFiles` variable then the 
there is no problem when we add any new templates to the  `./public/templates/` directory, but if we are to parse the files manually by hardcoding it, then we need
to change the list of files to be parse every single time, so in simple words, don't do it hardcoded way, use our allFiles method, and if you have come up with a better way
then send in a pull request!.

##Example

file `views/views.go`

			package views
			
			import (
				"io/ioutil"
				"net/http"
				"os"
				"strconv"
				"strings"
				"text/template"
			)
			
			var (
				homeTemplate      *template.Template
				deletedTemplate   *template.Template
				completedTemplate *template.Template
				loginTemplate	  *template.Template
				editTemplate      *template.Template
				searchTemplate    *template.Template
				templates         *template.Template
				message           string 
				//message will store the message to be shown as notification
				err               error
			)
			
			//PopulateTemplates is used to parse all templates present in
			//the templates folder
			func PopulateTemplates() {
				var allFiles []string
				templatesDir := "./public/templates/"
				files, err := ioutil.ReadDir(templatesDir)
				if err != nil {
					fmt.Println("Error reading template dir")
				}
				for _, file := range files {
					filename := file.Name()
					if strings.HasSuffix(filename, ".html") {
						allFiles = append(allFiles, templatesDir+filename)
					}
				}
			
				if err != nil {
					fmt.Println(err)
					os.Exit(1)
				}
				templates, err = template.ParseFiles(allFiles...)
				if err != nil {
					fmt.Println(err)
					os.Exit(1)
				}
				homeTemplate = templates.Lookup("home.html")
				deletedTemplate = templates.Lookup("deleted.html")
			
				editTemplate = templates.Lookup("edit.html")
				searchTemplate = templates.Lookup("search.html")
				completedTemplate = templates.Lookup("completed.html")
				loginTemplate = templates.Lookup("login.html")
			
			}
			
			//ShowAllTasksFunc is used to handle the "/" URL which is the default ones
			//TODO add http404 error
			func ShowAllTasksFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
				if r.Method == "GET" {
					context := db.GetTasks("pending") 
					//true when you want non deleted notes
					if message != "" {
						context.Message = message
					}
					homeTemplate.Execute(w, context)
					message = ""
				} else {
					message = "Method not allowed"
					http.Redirect(w, r, "/", http.StatusFound)
				}
			}

###Looping through arrays

			<div class="timeline">
				{{ if .Tasks}} 
					{{range .Tasks}}
						<div class="note">
						<p class="noteHeading">{{.Title}}</p>
						<hr>
						<p class="noteContent">{{.Content}}</p>
						</div>
					{{end}} 
				{{else}}
					<div class="note">
						<p class="noteHeading">No Tasks here</p>
						<p class="notefooter">Create new task<button> here </button> </p>
					</div>
				{{end}}
			</div>

the `{{ if .Tasks}} ` block checks if the array is empty or not, if it is not then it'll go to the `{{ .range .Tasks }}` which will loop through
the array, then the `{{.Title}}` will access the title and `{{.Content}}` will access the `Content` of that particular Task instance and 
we'll see all the tasks as a list.

##Homework
1. Take the html pages from http://github.com/thewhitetulip/omninotesweb and modify them to suit our purposes
	We would need to create one template each for the ones we mentioned in the above variable declaration, use templating as far
	as possible and later check your results with http://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks, please do the exercise on your own first 
	and then only check the Tasks repository.
2. 	Implement a search interface. Take a query as input, search tasks for that query and return an html page with 
	the query highlighted in the resulting page.
