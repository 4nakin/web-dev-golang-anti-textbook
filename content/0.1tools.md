# Tools

There are a wide variety of tools available for programming ranging from the all time favourite of command line users vi/emacs to Eclipse. Earlier I used to be 
a fan of the barebone, I used to customize everything on my machine, which ran some custom build of OpenSUSE or some highly customized Ubuntu fork
but what I later realized is that I was wasting a lot of time doing metadata rather than building stuff, so I started to use existing tools
to build non existing tools. Now I keep `vi` as my editor when I don't want to go beyond the terminal but I use vscode for all my programming purposes
because utilizing an existing non command line is a better option for me for it gives me a much simple interface to what I normally do on the command line, as far
as vscode is concerned, it gives me a non intrusive interface to git and a good environment for golang once you install the necessary tools.   

Citing that as enlightenment the following are tools I'd recommend for webdev with golang:

1. Visual Studio Code with golang plugin (A simple yet sophisticated text editor with a easy git interface)
2. Brackets Editor for html coding
3. The plain old terminal for go builds (To unleash the power of the commandline)

This recommendation doesn't want to spark a war of IDEs in which we argue x IDE sucks and y IDE rocks, IDEs are subject to usage and it all depends on the person, if
you are a `vi` wizard then, by all means go use vi, you might want to check out `vim-go` for that though. 

#####Note: gofmt
gofmt is a built in formatting tool. This simple tool formats our gocode according to the standard format, so it doesn't matter who wrote it because once we
want to check in the code, we can format it, this saves a *lot* of time. Almost all IDEs provide the gofmt on save feature, 
if they don't then you might want to use github.com/thewhitetulip/gofmtall.

The code is:
file: 	`~/bash_scripts/gofmtall`

	gofiles=`find * | grep .go`
	for file in $gofiles
	do
			if [ -f $file ]; then
					`gofmt -w $file`
			fi
	done
	
Executing `$ chmod 777 gofmtall` on the commandline gives read/write/execute permission to all users

Save this to gofmtall, place it in `~/bash_scripts` and add the folder to the $PATH variable, so whenever you create new projects
then you can run gofmtall on the root of your project and it'll format everything inside that project which is a go file.

It is a good practice to run gofmt on our code before committing to version control.

This is one of the best parts of golang, if you are familiar with python then there are multiple standards like the 4 space rule or the 2 space rule
or the tab rule, in other languages like shell/C/C++ there are multiple ways to format a codebase and it is truly uncomfortable to see code written in some other way
for instance this

`example 1.0`

			func void PrintSomething() {
				
			}
		
`example 1.1`

			func void PrintSomething() 
			{
				
			}

For me, seeing the second piece of code is *annoying*, why can't people just format the code in example 1.0 way?
Well, the ones who do, ask me the same question! Because example1.1 is a syntax error in golang.

This way when multiple people work on the same codebase, it won't look like an alien with automated code review tools or someone else for that matter touches 
the code base and it is a way to reduce the formatting wars and getting things done in the language.

So the go authors came up with this amazing solution, a built in tool which formats gocode in the standard way.

`godoc`

Godoc is a built in documentation tool, when we write gocode, we are expected to give comments to each exported function and pretty much every important place
because the exported functions are to be used by some random third party, they *should* have a comment explaining their use and the syntax. Also godoc scans your `$GOPATH`
and generates documentation on a server, the `golang.org` website is godoc running in production.

The -v flag is for verbose, for some reason godoc doesn't notify the user by printing on the terminal that "server started on port 8080", so we have to use the -v mode to get to know
when the server started running, because it is rather annoying to keep opening the `localhost:6060` URL ten times when in the fifteenth time the server has started.

Usage: `godoc -http=:6060 -v`
