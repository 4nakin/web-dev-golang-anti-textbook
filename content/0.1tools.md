# Tools

For html: Brackets, a text editor for the web by Adobe.

For Go: Any IDE of your choice which has a Go language plugin.

### gofmt

Usage:

	gofmt <file name> : prints the formatted source code on the console
	gofmt -w <file name/folder name>: writes the formatted code inside the file(s).

gofmt formats the source code of a Go source file/files in a folder. The basic point behind the Go language is that they have standardized formatting. The language authors wanted to create a language that gets things done quickly and didn't want the users of the language to wage in the endless debate on trivial issues like the code formatting. Most IDEs can be configured to run gofmt on save. It is recommended to run gofmt before committing to version control.

### godoc

Documentation in Go, is done via comments, each exported function/variable is supposed to have respective comments on what it does. The command godoc is the standard documentation generation tool. It extracts documentation comments on all the Go projects present in `$GOPATH/src`. It's a good practice to give proper documentation while programming, to make the code easier to understand for newcomers, for closed source and open source projects alike. 

######Note:

godoc, by default runs on the entire $GOPATH, so depending on the projects you have in your $GOPATH, it might take from few seconds to few minutes for godoc to start the server, godoc doesn't notify you when the server has started, they do have a verbose flag which prints when the server has started. It is `-v`

There are two modes for godoc, 

* Web interface: 
Usage: `godoc -http=:6060 -v` 

For seeing documentation of `net/http` the link is `localhost:6060/pkg/net/http`

* Command line interface
Usage: godoc net/http

This will provide the documentation of net/http

### go test

This is the testing toolchain for Go. For each `file.go`, the corresponding test cases should be present in a file named as file_test.go. 
If main.go is our Go source file, we should make main_test.go file in the same folder as main.go. The Go compiler ignores all the _test.go files.

### go build

We use this command to do to build our application. It parses all the .go files except the _test.go files in the entire folder and all sub folders along with imported libraries if any, and creates a statically linked binary. The binary name is the same as the project folder name, if we want a custom name we should use the -o flag. 

Example: `go build -o tasks` 

##### Note Cross compilation

With Go, you can cross compile your application. Below is the code to compile the application for Windows and Mac from Linux. 

	env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=386 go build -o tasks.app
	env GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o tasks.exe

If there are no quirks on the libraries, should give you a binary for the respective platforms.

### go install

This command creates a statically linked binary and places it in $GOPATH/bin folder. It also creates a binary version of all the dependent libraries and puts it in the $GOPATH/pkg folder in the respective directories.

##### Note

While building your application, first use `go install` which'll cache your dependent libraries. Then for subsequent changes use `go build`, this will save a lot of build time. This is because `go build` doesn't cache any results, it builds everything. 
 
### go run

While running your app through the command line you typicall have to do the following:
	go build -o app
	./app

`go run` combines them into one command, it generates and runs a binary of your project. The binary file, however isn't retained after the run.  

### go get

This is used to install packages in Go. It internally clones the version control repository parameter passed to it, can be any local/remote git repository. It then runs `go install` on the library, making the library available in $GOPATH/pkg.
