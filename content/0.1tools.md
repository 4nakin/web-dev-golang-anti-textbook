For Go: Any IDE of your choice which has a Go language plugin.

###gofmt

gofmt is a built in formatting tool. This simple tool formats our gocode according to the standard format, so it doesn't matter who wrote it because once we
want to check in the code, we can format it, this saves a *lot* of time. Almost all IDEs provide the gofmt on save feature, 
then you can use this `go fmt ./...`

It is a good practice to run gofmt on our code before committing to version control since it standardizes formatting of the entire codebase.

This is one of the best parts of Go, if you are familiar with Python then there are multiple standards like the 4 space rule or the 2 space rule
or the tab rule, in other languages like shell/C/C++ there are multiple ways to format code and it is truly uncomfortable to see code written in some other way
for instance this

`example 1.0`

			func void PrintSomething() {
				
			}
		
`example 1.1`

			func void PrintSomething() 
			{
				
			}

For me, seeing the second piece of code is *annoying*, why can't people just format the code in example 1.0 way?
Well, the ones who do, ask me the same question! But example1.1 is a syntax error in Go, so this argument is now null and void.

This way when multiple people work on the same codebase, it won't look like an alien with automated code review tools or someone else for that matter touches 
the code base and it is a way to reduce the formatting wars and getting things done in the language.

So the go authors came up with this amazing solution, a built in tool which formats gocode in the standard way.

###godoc

Godoc is a built in documentation tool, when we write gocode, we are expected to give comments to each exported function and pretty much every important place
because the exported functions are to be used by some random third party, they *should* have a comment explaining their use and the syntax. Also godoc scans your `$GOPATH`
and generates documentation on a server, the `golang.org` website is godoc running in production. When you start the godoc server, you'll notice that it gives you 
a html front end to the documentation of *all* your Go code,

The -v flag is for verbose, for some reason godoc doesn't notify the user by printing on the terminal that "server started on port 8080", so we have to use the -v mode to get to know
when the server started running, because it is rather annoying to keep opening the `localhost:6060` URL ten times when in the fifteenth time the server has started.

Usage: `godoc -http=:6060 -v`


### go test

`go test` is the testing tool for Go. If you are writing the test cases for `main.go` the file should be called `main_test.go`. We'll see more about testing in later
chapters where we start to write Go code.
