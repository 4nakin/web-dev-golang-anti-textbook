# Tools

There are a wide variety of tools available for programming ranging from the all time favourite of command line users, earlier even I used to be 
a fan of the barebone, I used to customize everything on my machine, which ran some custom build of OpenSUSE or some highly customized Ubuntu fork
but what I later realized is that I was wasting a lot of time doing metadata rather than building stuff, so I started to use existing tools
to build non existing tools. Citing that as enlightenment the following are tools I'd recommend for webdev with golang

1. Visual Studio Code with golang plugin
2. Brackets Editor for html coding
3. The plain old terminal for go builds

If you aren't a fan of this list then you might use any IDE of your choice, almost every IDE has a go plugin these days, so it won't matter which one
you are using, things were different a few years ago though. I won't list all options though, find one IDE which suits you and stick to it.

There is little point in arguing which IDE is the best, it is a matter of opinion and no matter what, everyone will have their opinion, so long
as you are well acquainted with the IDE of your choice it doesn't matter because you know how to use your IDE well.
