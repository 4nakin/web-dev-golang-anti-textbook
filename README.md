#About the book

This book was written to teach how developing web applications in golang for people who know a bit of golang and have basic information about web applications in general. Whilst almost each book attempts to teach web dev with golang with teaching first about the language and then puts a cursory glance over the most important aspects of webdev namely authentication. Most books are written to appeal to people who want to learn webdev and the language, so here I won't be teaching the language. This is about how to write a webapp in golang, we'll create a todo list manager throughout the book.

I hereby present to you the anti text book.
