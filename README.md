#About the book

Please note that the book is a work in progress.

This book was written to teach how to develop web applications in Go for people who know a bit of Go and have basic information about web applications in general. 

We (you) will build a webapp without using a third party framework and using as few external libraries as possible. The advantage is that you'll learn a lot when you code without a framework.

I hereby present to you the anti text book.

##Contributing
I don't profess to be a God of either Go or webdev or anything in general, and I don't claim that this is the best book for learning how to build web appplications with Go, but I do believe that good things happen when people collaborate, so pull requests are not only appreciated, but they are welcome.

Written with love in India.
