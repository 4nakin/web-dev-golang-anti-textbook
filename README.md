#About the book

This book was written to teach how developing web applications in golang for people who know a bit of golang and have basic information about web applications in general. Whilst almost each book attempts to teach web dev with golang with teaching first about the language and then puts a cursory glance over the most important aspects of webdev namely authentication and so, and if not then they focus more on the theory rather than practical with examples which are examples to demonstrate the xyz feature. Most books are written to appeal to people who want to learn webdev and the language, so here I won't be teaching the language. This book is about how to write a webapp in golang, we'll create a todo list manager throughout the book and implement features which we teach in chapters.

In this book we'll build a webapp without using a third party framework, but we'll use certain libraries which facilitate
few aspects like handling sessions, authentication, but we will strive to write our own solutions first. This approach has multiple benefits that include the fact that framworks encapsulates most aspects of webdev to the users, that is precisely their purposes for one might not use a framework which needs you to implement everything from scratch, but when we don't use frameworks then we stand a chance of learning a lot of stuff and we can create our own framework to use in the future for a framework is nothing but a template at a project level.

I hereby present to you the anti text book.


##Contributing
I don't profess to be a God of either golang or webdev or anything in general, but I don't claim that this is the best book for learning how to build web appplications with golang, but I do believe that good things happen when people collaborate, so pull requests are not only appreciated, but they are welcome.

Written with love in India.
