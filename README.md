#About the book

This book was written to teach how developing web applications in golang for people who know a bit of golang and have basic information about web applications in general. 

We(you) will build a webapp without using a third party framework and using as less external libraries as possible. The advantage is that you'll learn a lot when you get to code without a framework.

I hereby present to you the anti text book.


##Contributing
I don't profess to be a God of either golang or webdev or anything in general, and I don't claim that this is the best book for learning how to build web appplications with golang, but I do believe that good things happen when people collaborate, so pull requests are not only appreciated, but they are welcome.

Written with love in India.
