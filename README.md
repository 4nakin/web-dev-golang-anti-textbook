#Note: the book is being updated, and will not be put on gitbook anymore, we'll be placing the book at [leanpub](http://leanpub.com/antitextbookGo/preview). This is why the text in the folder manuscript is latest, the one in coetent is the old one.

This book was written to teach how to develop web applications in Go. 

You will create a to do list application as you go along with the book. Learning anything is faster when it is done via examples, this book strives to teach maximum concepts by examples.

This book is open source at [Github Repo](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/web-dev-golang-anti-textbook/).

##Code 
There is a code section available in the Github repo for reference.

##Contributing
I don't profess to be a God of either Go or webdev or anything in general, and I don't claim that this is the best book for learning how to build web appplications with Go, but I do believe that good things happen when people collaborate, so pull requests are not only appreciated, but they are welcome.

I got feedback from a reddit user that maybe it is too early for me to start writing this book. Decades ago, a young student from the University of Helsinki had an endless debate with Andrew Tannenbaum on comp.minix. It was about monolithic kernels. Had the student listened to Andrew Tannenbaum, the world probably would not have had Linux. This is the whole point of open source projects, a little initiative from everyone goes a long way.

##Philosophy
 - Through this book we want to teach how to develop web applications in Go. We expect the reader to know the basics of Go but we assume the reader knows **nothing** about how to write web applications.
 - The book shall comprise of chapters, if the topic is huge and doesn't fit into one chapter, then we split into multiple chapters, if possible.
 - Each chapter should be split into logical parts or sections with a meaningful title which'll teach the reader something.
 - Every concept should be accompanied by the Go code (if there is any), for *sneak peek* type sections write the Go pseudo code, writing just the necessary parts of the code and keeping everything else.
 - The code shouldn't be more than 80 characters wide because in the PDF versions of the book the code is invisible.
 - *Brevity is the soul of wit*, please keep the description as small as possible. This doesn't mean we skip it, but try to explain it in as simple words as possible.
     in such cases do explain the concept.
 - In the todo list manager which we are creating, we'll strive to implement as much functionality as possible to give a taste of practical Go programming to the reader. In cases where we re-implement stdlib stuff, we should mention it clearly.
 - The main title should have one #, sections should have 2 #'s sub section should have 4 and notes should have 6 #'s (note should have a title too).
 - Multi-line code should have three tabs indentation, single line of code can be indented using tabs or by backticks.

Written with love in India.
