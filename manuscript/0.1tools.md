# Tools

For HTML: Brackets, a text editor for the web by Adobe.

For Go: Any IDE of your choice which has a Go language plugin.

The Go programming language comes with a set of tools along with the standard installation. These tools were designed to help in the development.

### gofmt

Usage:

	gofmt <file name> : prints the formatted source code on the console
	gofmt -w <file name/folder name>: writes the formatted code inside the file(s).

gofmt formats the source code of a Go source file/files in a folder. The Go language standardized formatting. The language authors wanted to create a language that gets things done quickly and didn't want the users of the language to wage in the endless debate on trivial issues like the code formatting, hence the compulsion. Most IDEs can be configured to run gofmt on save. It is recommended to run gofmt before committing to version control.

### godoc

`godoc` is the documentation generation tool. It extracts documentation comments on all the Go projects present in `$GOPATH/src`, along with the standard library.

It has two interfaces:

* Web: 

	Usage: `godoc -http=:6060 -v` 

	For seeing documentation of `net/http` the link is `localhost:6060/pkg/net/http`.
	This has a distinct advantage that we can read the source code of Go itself via the webserver, since Go 1.6, the Go language itself is written in Go.

	######Note: Verbose flag

	godoc, by default runs on the entire $GOPATH, so depending on the projects you have in your $GOPATH, it might take from few seconds to few minutes for godoc to start the server, godoc doesn't notify you when the server has started, they do have a verbose flag which prints when the server has started. It is `-v`

* Commandline:

	Usage: godoc net/http

	This will provide the documentation of net/http on the terminal, in many cases this is better than the web version. 
	The only catch here is that we need to know the exact library name.

	Please note that your code needs to have documentation for it to show in godoc, if we don't have any documentation in the code, then it'll just show blank pages.

######Note: Documentation

As we saw earlier, the documentation is generated for all the exported objects beacuse when we use libraries developed by other developers, this is the documentation which we want. We can also provide documentation comments to explain the logic, but that won't be covered inside the godoc.

### go test

This is the testing toolchain for Go. For each `file.go`, the corresponding test cases should be present in a file named as `file_test.go` in the same folder where `file.go` is present. The Go compiler ignores all the `*_test.go` files.

Typically every business operation requires a unit test case, this leads to a large test case set, speed isn't a problem with static compiled language. Suppose you already have a hundred test cases and you add `TestValueAdd` test case as a part of a new feature. While developing that feature, until you are sure it does what it should, you want to run only that one test case, you can run it as `go test -run ValueAdd`. 

After we are satisfied with this testcase, we anyways have to run the entire suit to make sure that this new functionality hasn't broken anything.

### go build

We can build our application using `go build`. It parses all the `.go` files except the `*_test.go` files in the entire folder and all sub folders along with imported libraries if any, and creates a statically linked binary. The binary name is the same as the project folder name, if we want a custom name we should use the -o flag. 

Example: `go build -o tasks` 

##### Note Build time

When we run `go build`, Go builds the entire application along with the depending libraries, if you want to speed up the build times, it is good if you run `go install` first, this would build your libraries into the `$GOPATH/pkg` folder and will use that directly. In short, it'll only build your application and not the libraries.

##### Note Cross compilation

With Go, you can cross compile your application. Below is the code to compile the application for Windows and Mac from Linux. 

	env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=386 go build -o tasks.app
	env GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o tasks.exe

If there are no quirks on the libraries, should give you a binary for the respective platforms.

### go install

This command creates a statically linked binary and places it in `$GOPATH/bin` folder. 
It also creates a binary version of all the dependent libraries and puts it in the $GOPATH/pkg folder in the respective directories.

We are required to put the `$GOPATH/bin` folder in the $PATH variable in the system so that we can use the tools from `$GOPATH/bin` from anywhere in the terminal.
 
### go run

While running your app through the command line you typicall have to do the following:

	go build -o app
	./app

`go run` combines them into one command, it generates the binary in the temp folder and runs it. The binary file isn't retained after the run.

### go get

This is used to install packages in Go. It internally clones the version control repository parameter passed to it, can be any local/remote git repository. It then runs `go install` on the library, making the library available in `$GOPATH/pkg`.
