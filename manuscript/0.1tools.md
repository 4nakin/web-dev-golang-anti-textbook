# Tools

1. HTML: Brackets, a text editor for the web by Adobe.
2. Go: Any IDE of your choice which has a Go language plugin.

## The toolchain

The Go programming language comes with a set of tools along with the standard installation. These tools were designed to help in the development.

#### gofmt

Usage:

	gofmt main.go : prints the formatted source code of main.go file on the console.
	gofmt -w main.go: writes the formatted code inside the file main.go
	gofmt -w Tasks: runs gofmt on all the files in the folder Tasks.

Most IDEs can be configured to run gofmt on save. It is recommended to run gofmt before committing to version control.

#### godoc

It is a documentation generation tool. It extracts documentation comments on all the Go projects present in `$GOPATH/src`, along with the standard library.

It has two interfaces:

* Web: 

	Usage: `godoc -http=:6060 -v` 

	For seeing documentation of `net/http` the link is `localhost:6060/pkg/net/http`.
	This has a distinct advantage that we can read the source code of Go itself via the webserver, since Go 1.6, the Go language itself is written in Go.

* Commandline:

	Usage: godoc net/http

	This will provide the documentation of net/http on the terminal, in many cases this is better than the web version. 
	The only catch here is that we need to know the exact library name.

	Please note that your code needs to have documentation for it to show in godoc, if we don't have any documentation in the code, then it'll just show blank pages.

######Note:	 Verbose flag (web mode)

godoc, by default runs on the entire $GOPATH, so depending on the projects you have in your $GOPATH, it might take from few seconds to few minutes for godoc to start the server, godoc doesn't notify you when the server has started, they do have a verbose flag which prints when the server has started. It is `-v`

######Note: Documentation

The documentation covered by godoc isn't the internal documentation about what the logic of the function is. It is the documentation about the API or application that you are building. When a new person reads the app's docs, they quickly understand about the functions and things become smooth for them to start being productive.

#### go test

Go has testing support built into the language. For each code file `file.go`, the corresponding test cases should be present in a file named as `file_test.go` in the same folder. The Go compiler ignores all the `*_test.go` files while building the application.

######Note: Incremental testing

An application requires suit of test cases. A suit is going to have a lot of test cases. Suppose you already have a hundred test cases and you add `TestValueAdd` test case as a part of a new feature. While developing that feature. While you are testing if the `TestValueAdd` feature works correctly, you want to run only that one test case.

In such cases, you can run it as `go test -run ValueAdd`. 

`-run` supports arguments as a regular expression.

After we are satisfied with this testcase, we have to run the entire test suit for integration testing.

#### go build

We can build our application using `go build`. It parses all the `.go` files except the `*_test.go` files in the entire folder and all sub folders along with imported libraries if any, and creates a statically linked binary. The binary name is the same as the project folder name, if we want a custom name we should use the -o flag. 

Example: `go build -o tasks` 

##### Note: Build time

When we run `go build`, Go builds the entire application along with the depending libraries, if you want to speed up the build times, it is good if you run `go install` first, this would build your libraries into the `$GOPATH/pkg` folder and will use that directly. In short, it'll only build your application and not the libraries.

##### Note: Cross compilation

With Go, you can cross compile your application. Below is the code to compile the application for Windows and Mac from Linux. 

	env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=386 go build -o tasks.app
	env GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o tasks.exe

If there are no quirks on the libraries, should give you a binary for the respective platforms.

#### go install

This command creates a statically linked binary and places it in `$GOPATH/bin` folder. 
It also creates a binary version of all the dependent libraries and puts it in the $GOPATH/pkg folder in the respective directories.

We are required to put the `$GOPATH/bin` folder in the $PATH variable in the system so that we can use the tools from `$GOPATH/bin` from anywhere in the terminal.
 
#### go run

While running your app through the command line you typicall have to do the following:

	go build -o app
	./app

`go run` combines them into one command, it generates the binary in the temp folder and runs it. The binary file isn't retained after the run.

#### go get

This is used to install packages in Go. It internally clones the version control repository parameter passed to it, can be any local/remote git repository. It then runs `go install` on the library, making the library available in `$GOPATH/pkg`.
