# Using databases in Go

Go doesn't provide out of the box support for any database, but it provides an interface, which can be used by database library creators to keep
all the database libraries compatible with each other.  

We will use sqlite for this book.

#### Creating and configuring database

Use this DDL to create a table in our database

    [Tasks] $ sqlite3 tasks.db
    SQLite version 3.8.2 2013-12-06 14:53:30
    Enter ".help" for instructions
    Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
    sqlite> CREATE TABLE task (
        id integer primary key autoincrement,
        title varchar(100),
        content text,
        is_deleted char(1) default 'N',
        created_date timestamp,
        last_modified_at timestamp,
        finish_date timestamp
        );
		
Use the following insert statements to enter data in our table, so we'll begin reading data in our ShowAllTasks function which we wrote in the previous chapter

    INSERT INTO "task" VALUES(1,'Publish on github',
        'Publish the source of tasks and picsort on github',
        'N','2015-11-12 15:30:59','2015-11-21 14:19:22',
        '2015-11-17 17:02:18');

    INSERT INTO "task" VALUES(4,'gofmtall',
        'The idea is to run gofmt -w file.go on every 
    go file in the listing, *Edit turns out this is is difficult 
    to do in golang **Edit barely 3 line bash script :P '
    ,'N','2015-11-12 16:58:31',
    '2015-11-14 10:42:14','2015-11-13 13:16:48');

    INSERT INTO "task" VALUES(7,'modifications to task',
        '1. add search function #Done
            2. a priority feature to task
            3. comments on tasks
            4. Due date
            5. remove dependency on httprouter #Done',
        'N','2015-11-13 04:23:27','2015-11-13 04:23:27',NULL);


#### Installing the sqlite driver for go

We'll use the go-sqlite3 driver created by [mattn](http://github.com/mattn). The reason being it implements the `database/sql` interface. 
Type this in your terminal:

    go get "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3" 

#### Accessing database in go

We import the library as `import _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"` 

The package is imported anonymously, when we import `net/http` we have to use `http.` to access the package. To be able to swap underlying databases, we won't do that. Thus the anonymous package import.

Under the hood, the driver registers itself to the database/sql package.

### Note The '_' operator

The `_` operator has a unique role in go, it is used to denote an empty variable, used when we want to ignore data.  
`nums` is an array, while we loop through arrays using range it returns a (key,value) pair. here we ignore the key and print the value.			

    for _, value := range nums {
        fmt.Println(value)
    }
		
Also note that we can give a package alias instead of the underscore character should we want an alias for our package.

Every database has a connection mechanism, file for sqlite and IP address for MySQL/Postgres.

We encapsulate our db object inside a struct. We also encapsulate the database actions as shown below

    var database Database
    
    //Database encapsulates database
    type Database struct {
        db *sql.DB
    }
    
    func (db Database) begin() (tx *sql.Tx) {
        tx, err := db.db.Begin()
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
            return nil
        }
        return tx
    }

    func (db Database) prepare(q string) (stmt *sql.Stmt) {
        stmt, err := db.db.Prepare(q)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
            return nil
        }
        return stmt
    }

    func (db Database) query(q string, 
        args ...interface{}) (rows *sql.Rows) {
          rows, err := db.db.Query(q, args...)
          if err != nil {
              log.Println(err)
              return nil
          }
          return rows
    }

    func init() {
        database.db, err = 
           sql.Open("sqlite3", "./newtask.db")
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    }

    //Close database connection
    func Close() {
        database.db.Close()
    }
    
    //taskQuery encapsulates Exec()
    func taskQuery(sql string, args ...interface{}) error {
        SQL := database.prepare(sql)
        tx := database.begin()
        _, err = tx.Stmt(SQL).Exec(args...)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("taskQuery: ", err)
            tx.Rollback()
        } else {
            tx.Commit()
        }
        return err
    }

#####Note init()
The init function is the first function to run when the package is imported or executed. This is why we do the initialization in it.

###### Note DB from godoc

    type DB struct {
        // contains filtered or unexported fields
    }

DB is a database handle representing a pool of zero or more underlying connections. It's safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

The sql package creates and frees connections automatically; it also maintains a free pool of idle connections. If the database has a concept of per-connection state, such state can only be reliably observed within a transaction. 
We do not want this variable to be accessible from outside the package so it is unexported. Open may just validate its arguments without creating a connection to the database. To verify that the data source name is valid, call `Ping()`.
The returned DB is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines and maintains its own pool of idle connections. Thus, the Open function should be called just once. It is rarely necessary to close a DB. 

    err = db.Ping()
    if err != nil {
        //do something about it
    }

The sql.DB object shoudn't be opened and closed frequently, it should be closed only when we no longer need to access the database.

> Please refer to the documentation of `database/sql` for more details.

###### Note exported and unexported variables

Exported: variable starts with a capital letter and is accessible for those who import this package
Unexported: variable is private for the package, not accessible outside it's declaration.

#### Querying the database

Statements that donâ€™t return rows should not use Query functions; they should use `Exec()`.

###### From the go documentation
	func (*DB) Exec
	
	func (db *DB) Exec(query string, args ...interface{}) (Result, error)
	
	Exec executes a query without returning any rows. The args are for any 
	placeholder parameters in the query. 

We use the `Query` method to query the database when we expect some result from the database.

    getTaskSQL = "select id, title, content, created_date from task
        where finish_date is null and is_deleted='N' order by created_date asc"
        
    rows, err := database.Query(getTaskSQL)
    
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
    }
    
    defer rows.Close()
    for rows.Next() {
        err := rows.Scan(&TaskID, &TaskTitle, &TaskContent, &TaskCreated)
        TaskContent = strings.Replace(TaskContent, "\n", "<br>", -1)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
        }
        fmt.Println(TaskID, TaskTitle, TaskContent, TaskCreated)
    }
    
    taskSQL := "delete from task"
    tx := database.begin()
	_, err = tx.Stmt(SQL).Exec(args...)
	if err != nil {
		tx.Rollback()
	} else {
		tx.Commit()
	}
	
###### Note defer keyword

We use defer inside a function call.
 
    package main
    import (
        "fmt"
        "io/ioutil"
        "os"
    )
    
    func main() {
        file, err := os.Open('file.dat')
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("File doesn't exist or you don't have
            read permission")
        }
        
        defer file.Close()
        inputReader := bufio.NewReader(file)
        //do something about inputReader
    }

The defer statement puts the function call at the bottom of the call stack, so whenever the function returns, defer is triggered. One has to be careful with using defer, it can cause difficult to find bugs.

file `~/main/main.go` 

Find and fix the bug:

    package main
    import (
        _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3" 
        "fmt"
    )
    
    var database   *sql.DB
    
    func init() {
        defer database.Close()
        database, err = sql.Open("sqlite3", "./tasks.db")
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
    }
    //intentional bug exists, fix it
    func main() {
        getTaskSQL = "select id, title, content, created_date from task
            where finish_date is null and is_deleted='N' order by created_date asc"
            
        rows, err := database.Query(getTaskSQL)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
        defer rows.Close()
        for rows.Next() {
            err := rows.Scan(&TaskID, &TaskTitle, &TaskContent, &TaskCreated)
            TaskContent = strings.Replace(TaskContent, "\n", "<br>", -1)
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println(err)
            }
            fmt.Println(TaskID, TaskTitle, TaskContent, TaskCreated)
        }
        err = rows.Err()
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    }

Always defer `rows.Close()`, to free the database connection in the pool. So long as `rows` contains the result set, the database connection is in use and not available in the connection pool. 

When the `rows.Next()` function returns EOF (End of File), which means that it has reached the end of records, it'll call `rows.Close()` for you, `Close()` can be called multiple times without side effects.

### Single-Row Queries 

If a query returns at most one row, you can use a shortcut:

	var taskDescription string
    query:="select taskDescription from task where id = ?"
	err = db.QueryRow(query, 1).Scan(&taskDescription)
	
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
			
	fmt.Println(taskDescription)

Errors from the query are deferred until `Scan()` is called, and then are returned from that. You can also call QueryRow() on a prepared statement:

	query :="select taskDescription from task where id = ?"
    stmt, err := db.Prepare(query, 1).Scan(&taskDescription)
		
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
			...
            
	var taskDescription string
	err = stmt.QueryRow(1).Scan(&taskDescription)
	
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
			
    fmt.Println(taskDescription)

### Writing data into the database

Above functions fetched data from the database, transactions are to be used to write data in the database.

Below lies an example of using transaction

file `db/db.go`

    //RestoreTask is used to restore tasks from the Trash
    func RestoreTask(id int) error {
        query := "update task set is_deleted='N',last_modified_at=datetime() where id=?"
        restoreSQL, err := database.Prepare(query)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
        tx, err := database.Begin()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
        _, err = tx.Stmt(restoreSQL).Exec(id)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("doing rollback")
            tx.Rollback()
        } else {
            tx.Commit()
        }
        return err
    }
 

### Prepare
Prepare creates a prepared statement for later queries or executions. Multiple queries or executions may be run concurrently from the returned statement. The caller must call the statement's Close method when the statement is no longer needed. 

###### Note Error handling
Because of Go's unique method of handling errors, we can be stuck in the if err != nil land. But, on the other hand it simplifies error handling as we just have to return the error message.

An excellent resource about Go and databases can be found at http://go-database-sql.org

##### The fault in our code:

Fixing the intentional bug in the above code:

	func init() {
			defer database.Close()
			database, err = sql.Open("sqlite3", "./tasks.db")
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println(err)
			}
		}
		
######Homework
See the `/code/chapter-4/4.5database` in our code repository and modify the file to insert data from the `4.3formsupload` folder.
We have two working code set, one of printing form values on the console and one of fetching db values and rendering a template.
What you have to do is based on this chapter, write methods to insert values from the form to the database.
